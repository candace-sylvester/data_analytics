# Bike Sales in Europe Dataset

This is a Bike Store Sales in Europe dataset I used this dataset to create two pivot tables. One comparing country and state against profit, cost, and revenue; from that datasheet the United States had the highest revenue, cost, and profit.
The second pivot table had country and state compared against the revenue made throughout the years 2011-2016. Australia had the highest revenue especially in the years 2013 and 2015. While the U.S. made the second-largest amount in the same years as Australia.
