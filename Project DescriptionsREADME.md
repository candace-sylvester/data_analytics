# Excel 
In the excel folder I created two pivot tables with the  Bike Store Sales in the Europe dataset.I used this dataset to create two pivot tables.One comparing country and state against profit, cost, and revenue; from that dataset the United States had the highest revenue, cost, and profit.
The second pivot table had country and state compared against the revenue made throughout the years 2011-2016. Australia had the highest revenue especially in the years 2013 and 2015. While the U.S. made the second-largest amount in the same years as Australia.
# Python
In the python folder there are 3 files called Diabetic Datset,Integer Identification dataset, and Sweetwater and Illinois Covid19 Death Cases.
The Diabetic Dataset - This dataset consists of patient and hospital outcomes of people diagnosed with diabetes; the task was to create a classfication model that shows if a patient is readmitted within 30 days or not.
Integer Identification dataset - For this project we had to ask users for a number and if it is an even or odd number print a message based on the number.
Sweetwater and Illinois Covid19 Deaths and Cases - I had to choose a county and a state and calculate the number of covid19 deaths and and cases and compare it against each other.
#  SQL
For SQL we had to create a videos table and reviewers table based on a tv show dataset that includes unique id, join statements etc.
# Tableau
This project included a list of options such as: Time Americans Spend Sleeping,Game of Thrones Deaths,and US State Wind Energy.I chose Game of Thrones Deaths and I decided to create a story with the characters and how they died.
